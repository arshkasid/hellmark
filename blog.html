<div class="blog-image-container">
<img src="assets/images/iiml1.jpg" class="blog-images"/>
</div>
<h5 class="mt-2">YOHO - You only Hel(L) once!</h5>
<p class="text-justify">IIM Lucknow, spread over 185 acres, is a world in itself with a residential facility for 1000+ students and faculty, departmental stores which stock everything from pins to bins, medical and stationery stores.</p>
<span id="dots1" style="display: inline; "></span><span id="more1" style="display: none;text-align: justify;"> The red buildings, well-maintained lawns, and the statue of Medusa add to the beauty of the campus. <br><br> 
So how does a typical day look like at IIM Lucknow, also popularly referred to Hel(L)? There is no single day that will look alike as Hell has a lot of surprise elements in store. The schedule here is rigorous. Sleep? You will have to make a trade-off between sleep and parties and assignments. There will be a lot of quizzes, both announced and surprise quizzes, followed by assignments, projects, presentations, and guest lectures lined up one after the other.
<h4 class="mt-2">Blissful Mornings (Part 1 of the day)</h4><br>

<p class="text-justify">Walking up to the sounds of peacocks, you can see a lot of people jogging/walking when there is no 8 am quiz. Most of the days, it is just the students rushing to their morning class from mess or straight from hostel rooms. There are usually around 4-5 hours of lectures every day which sometimes happen till 6 pm.</p>
<h4>Pleasant Evenings (Part 2 of the day)</h4><br>
<div class="blog-image-container">
  <img src="assets/images/walk.jpg" class="blog-images"/>
</div>
<p class="text-justify">Evenings are so lively at Hell. The campus offers various choices for you to spend your evening. You can choose to spend it in sports grounds, go for an evening walk or meet your group members to discuss your projects. A lot of Clubs, Committees, and Academic Interest groups (aka CCAs) organize their competitions, speaker sessions, and fun events.
</p>
<h4>Demanding Night Life (Part 3 of the day)</h4><br>
<p class="text-justify">Insti-parties (Institute parties) keep happening now and then, to add more colour to your rigorous academic life. The beats of the DJ let you dance against the rhythms of boring life. Other times, students usually gossip among friends, get ready for birthday bumps, and even prepare for the next day’s class or quizzes. Most of them visit night mess (operates from 11 pm to 3 am) to share and lament how their day went with scrumptious food. No matter how happy, sad, or tired you are, the night mess food does its magic.<br><br>
Dance and art workshops, the DJ nights, Sangarsh, Camaraderie, and various other events come to rescue you from the over-demanding academic schedule. Sundays are always uncertain. Not every Sunday is an off day if you are a Hel(L)’ite and not to forget deadlines are sacrosanct.<br><br>
Welcome to the HEL(L)! </p>

<div class="row justify-content-center" id="hostel">
<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8 col-lg-10 mt-4">
<h2 class="blog-title mt-4 mb-2">Hostel Life at L	</h2>
<div class="blog-image-container">
<img src="assets/images/hostel.jpg" class="blog-images"/>
</div>
<h5 class="mt-2">Home away from Home!</h5>
<p class="text-justify">When the first-year students enter the IIM Lucknow campus, they have a prevalent misconception that HelL is all about work and no play. On the contrary, the hostel life at HelL helps the students balance the academic rigor and their packed schedules. Instead, it would be full of fun and happy memories that the students could cherish later on.</p>
<span id="dots2" style="display: inline; "></span><span id="more2" style="display: none;text-align: justify;"> IIM Lucknow is set amidst a sprawling area of 200 acres, and it is a fully residential institute housing both the faculties and the students. There are 17 student hostels on the campus (a.k.a H1 to H17). The hostels have single-occupancy rooms, which are spacious, and the rooms have a bed, a closet, and a study table. Each room has two big-screened doors, a window, and a small balcony. In addition to this, each hostel room is provided with intranet and Wi-Fi facilities to make the students' lives easier and connected. <br><br> 
<h4 class="mt-2">Hostel blocks</h4><br>

<p class="text-justify">Each hostel has its perks. For instance, if you are in a hostel from H1 to H8, you are fairly close to the mess and the academic blocks. Hence you do not have to skip your meals, and the fun fact is that you can start just 5 minutes before the class to be on time. Whereas, if you are in Hostel H15 or H16, which is more than a kilometer away from the academic blocks, then attending the early morning 9 am classes is a challenge (if you're a late night owl). But Hostel H16 is dubbed as the party hostel, and the late-night fun on the campus happens here. Be it the insti-parties or the inauguration of the camaraderie (inter-section wars); everything happens at H16. There are other prime locations like the Titanic over H10, H15, common areas and connectors that connect between adjacent hostels. The fun does not stop here, and even some enthusiastic hosts (of course, they'll be your fellow batchmates) organize parties in their room. In short, the nightlife at hostels H1 to H8 is entirely in contrast to that of hostels H9 to H16.</p>
<h4>Facilities in & around the Hostels</h4><br>
<!--div class="blog-image-container">
  <img src="assets/images/iiml1.jpg" class="blog-images"/>
</div-->
<p class="text-justify">There is a wide range of sports facilities at IIML for both outdoor and indoor games. To name a few, the hostels have facilities for badminton courts, table tennis, and carrom. The students can access them 24/7.<br><br>Kudos to the Mess Committee (Trivia - IIM L mess is run solely by the students) for installing vending machines at different parts of the hostels and the academic blocks. This aids the students in pulling off frequent all-nighters (be it parties or exams) with ease. Besides this, the night mess also delivers food to hostels so that it would make the life of students easier in hostels farther from the mess. Moreover, the food outlets within the campus have some exciting menus that the students would not be able to resist. Although the IIM Lucknow campus is located at a distance of about 8 km on the city's outskirts, the students can enjoy the liberty of ordering from restaurants like Dominos and KFC.
<br><br>The campus also houses a well-stocked mini departmental store run by Kendriya Bhandar, Post Office, Bank, and a Health Centre. The library at IIM Lucknow is a spacious 30,000 sq. ft. two-storied building. The students can access this facility 24 x 7 to enrich themselves.<br><br>Initially, life as a HelL’ite might seem like a daunting challenge, but once you enter the campus and go through all the experiences with your peers, you would reminisce and miss them when you leave the campus.<br>

<div class="row justify-content-center" id="jargons">
<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8 col-lg-10 mt-4">
<h2 class="blog-title mt-4 mb-2">Language of L	</h2>
<div class="blog-image-container">
<img src="assets/images/iiml1.jpg" class="blog-images"/>
</div>
<h5 class="mt-2"></h5>
<p class="text-justify">Much of MBA, put simply, is about adding jargon to common sense. For a freshman embarking upon the B-school journey, it is essential to acquaint himself with the campus lingo, which otherwise might sound like Greek. Like Hogwarts’ “Expecto Patronum”, IIM Lucknow has a plethora of colloquial jargons. Here are the most common ones:</p>
<span id="dots3" style="display: inline; "></span><span id="more3" style="display: none;text-align: justify;">  <br><br> 
<h4 class="mt-2">1. Hel(L):</h4><br>

<p class="text-justify">Any idea – why IIM L is called Hel(L)???.... Given its academic rigor, IIM Lucknow is popularly called HelL, but believe me for a fact, by the time you graduate, the only word that you’d use to describe this place would be “heaven”. HelL eventually turns out to be a misnomer amidst the immense opportunities that the campus offers. The inmates of HelL are called: HelLites, HelLions, HelL-Riders, and so on.</p>
<h4>2. Globe:</h4><br>
<div class="blog-image-container">
  <img src="assets/images/globe.gif" class="blog-images"/>
</div>
<p class="text-justify"><br>Globe refers to bombastic verbiage laced with fancy business faff, usually making less or no sense. Despite being overrated, it is one essential skill to have to survive at HelL. Among the various skills that MBA teaches you, ‘Globe’ing is one of them. The one who globes frequently is called a Globe-Master.</p>
<h4>3. BG-1 & BG-2:</h4><br>
<div class="blog-image-container">
  <img src="assets/images/bodhi.jpg" class="blog-images"/>
</div>
<p class="text-justify">BG-1 and BG-2, perhaps the place where you would end up spending maximum time and making the best memories, stands for Bodhi Grih-1 and Bodhi Grih-2. They are the academic blocks that have all classrooms and exam halls.<br><br>
<h4>4. DCP:</h4><br>
<img src="assets/images/dcp.gif" class="blog-images"/>
<p class="text-justify"><br>DCP or Desperate Class Participation is an act of overtly and desperately putting forth one’s opinion during a class discussion with the sole motive of gaining some extra class participation marks. Another three-lettered word very similar to DCP is ACP or After Class Participation (self-explanatory).</p>
<h4>5. Free-Rider:</h4><br>
<div class="blog-image-container">
  <img src="assets/images/free ride gif.gif" class="blog-images"/>
</div>
<p class="text-justify"><br>Free-Rider is an adjective used to describe a person who makes less or no contribution to a group project, more so without any guilt of reaping the fruits of others’ efforts. All project groups, with no exception, have a free rider.</p>
<h4>6. Fauji:</h4><br>
<div class="blog-image-container">
  <img src="assets/images/3.4.jpg" class="blog-images"/>
</div>
<p class="text-justify"><br>A picturesque spot-on campus with a green meadow on one side and general stores on the other. Fondly called, ‘Fauji area’ where musical gatherings happen occasionally.</p>
<h4>7. Lite-lo:</h4><br>
<div class="blog-image-container">
  <img src="assets/images/Lite lo gif.gif" class="blog-images"/>
</div>
<p class="text-justify"><br>You’ll hear this very frequently. “Lite-le” would generally mean “don’t take stress”, but this is a fairly versatile term and has various other usages too. For example: “Is plan ko Lite-lo” would mean let's drop the plan, “Ye lite course hai” would mean “We will sail through this course”.</p>
<h4>8. Medusa:</h4><br>
<div class="blog-image-container">
  <img src="assets/images/medussa.jpg" class="blog-images"/>
</div>
<p class="text-justify">Another campus spot with a gigantic statue resembling Medusa. It is the place for some deep moment of soul searching or to enjoy a moment of solace. In fact, the IIM L store – HellMark’s logo traces its origin from the Medusa statue on the campus.</p>
<h4>9. CC:</h4><br>
<div class="blog-image-container">
  <img src="assets/images/cc.jpg" class="blog-images"/>
</div>
<p class="text-justify">CC or the Computer Centre will be your go-to place for discussing group projects, taking print-outs or for simply chilling in AC.</p>
<h4>10. Titanic:</h4><br>
<div class="blog-image-container">
  <img src="assets/images/Titanic.gif" class="blog-images"/>
</div>
<p class="text-justify"><br>For all the party animals, the Titanic is the destination. The coolest party place on the campus. Wondering why it is called Titanic? Well, that’s for you to discover.</p>

<p class="text-justify">By now, you would have found this article is nothing but a Globe...Yes, it is..:P</p>

<h5 class="mt-2"></h5>
<p class="text-justify">Finally belled the CAT, then made through rounds of WAT & PI. That was one HelL of a journey indeed. Wasn’t that? And roughly 2 months before you sink yourself in the realm of the legendary campus that is fondly called Hel(L).
Counting days to it? Well, that shall come soon too.
</p>
<span id="dots4" style="display: inline; "></span><span id="more4" style="display: none;text-align: justify;"> The red buildings, well-maintained lawns, and the statue of Medusa add to the beauty of the campus. <br><br> 
This is the phase of new aspirations, anxiety, happiness & lots of wondering & pondering over what to do, how to prepare oneself, and how to be the best among the best. The period before an MBA is a great time for reflection and mentally preparing yourself to potentially reinvent yourself. To help you out, the IIM L Store – HellMark has prepared a list of To-Do things before we welcome you here.
<h4 class="mt-2">1.	Learn Excel & Powerpoint, No Excuses!</h4><br>

<p class="text-justify"><br>Excel & Powerpoint may seem to be a piece of cake but don’t undermine the proficiency needed for any management graduate. Irrespective of your background, it will be helpful for you to learn them because, to put it simply, they will be the bread and butter for your next 2 years. Go skills website (https://www.goskills.com/) has a free trial for the first 7 days. Complete at least a couple of courses at this time. “Excel Advanced” is a must. Also, you can check out Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/). They have very reasonably priced courses too.</p>
<h4>2.	Of ‘the holy’ CV & Resume</h4><br>
<div class="blog-image-container">
  <img src="assets/images/CV gif.gif" class="blog-images"/>
</div>
<p class="text-justify"><br>These 2 months will be the perfect time to recollect what you did & achieved in life and get the first draft of your CV ready. Start collecting all the points you can think of, big or small, relevant or irrelevant. Once you’re on campus, you will be inundated with academic rigor, committee selections, and before you realize anything, you will be sitting for your summers. So, buckle up, buoy!
</p>
<h4>3.	Math & Finance Anxiety? Shoo them away!</h4><br>

<p class="text-justify"><br>As most of you must be aware, the first year of MBA does no discrimination based on your previous Karma. Engineers will have to go through the finance courses in all three terms, and Commerce grads have no relief with heavy Quant courses in all three terms. So, what to do? It will be a good idea to have a basic math preparation & get comfy with finance & accounting terms.
 Engineers, we feel you!

<a href="https://www.udemy.com/basics-of-business-finance/">(Basics in Business Finance)</a>
Commerce grads, hey there! Every year before first-year students join the program, IIM L would offer a math preparatory course of its own. Do try to enroll for that if you feel it’s needed.
<br><br>
<h4>4.	One more Presentation? Interviews, Oh no! </h4><br>
<div class="blog-image-container">
  <img src="assets/images/Phoebe gif.gif" class="blog-images"/>
</div>
<p class="text-justify"><br>Be it presentations, networking, or company selections, Soft skills will always be the icing on the cake of your technical know-how. So, if you’re good, become better and if you’re not good, but this time to use.<br>

<h4>5.	Do whatever you love </h4><br>
<div class="blog-image-container">
  <img src="assets/images/Travel.gif" class="blog-images"/>
</div>
<p class="text-justify"><br>We cannot stress this enough. Quit your job as soon as you can and GO EXPLORE! No matter how important the things said above are, make sure you don’t lose out on doing what would seem to be a luxury once here. Catch up with all your friends, spend quality time with your family, or do whatever thing you like. SEIZE this MOMENT!!!</p>
WILL SEE YOU ALL SOON AT THE CAMPUS! STAY SAFE!!! </p>

  <img src="assets/images/3.4.jpg" class="blog-images"/>
</div>
<p class="text-justify">If you thought MBA was just about the 3Ps(Padhai, Placements and PPTs), well, you were wrong. The IIM L fraternity celebrates every festival, every occasion, every event with full fervour. Insti-parties organised at the campus are crazy fun. That is where you switch from networking to some real bonding.</p>
<h4>Manfest-Varchasva:</h4><br>
<div class="blog-image-container">
  <img src="assets/images/mv.jpg" class="blog-images"/>
</div>
<p class="text-justify">IIM Lucknow hosts two mega-scale fests- Manfest Varchasva and INDEX. The only time you will get to meet your friends from other B-Schools in Campus would be during these. Besides, getting to organize these fests will be a learning in itself.</p>
<h4>Live Projects and Case Competitions:</h4><br>
<div class="blog-image-container">
  <!--img src="assets/images/iiml1.jpg" class="blog-images"/-->
</div>
<p class="text-justify">The real hands-on learning, take it for every word, happens through case competitions and live projects from companies, corporates and clubs. Each time you do a case competition your understanding of the concerned sector becomes crystal clear from head to heel. A case could be something as big as planning a Kumbh Mela, planning the launch of a brand or running a live campaign.</p>
<h4>Section Wars:</h4><br>
<div class="blog-image-container">
  <!--img src="assets/images/iiml1.jpg" class="blog-images"/-->
</div>
<p class="text-justify">Camaraderie the inter-section war, where all 9 sections fight for the ultimate trophy, fosters fevicol bond among the inmates of every section, a bond that lasts forever. Three days of crazy fun-dancing, singing, painting, eating, playing, spamming and what not. By hook or by crook, every section fights to its full might. Sangram, the sports war is another big inter-section event.</p>
<h4>Birthday Celebrations:</h4><br>
<div class="blog-image-container">
  <!--img src="assets/images/iiml1.jpg" class="blog-images"/-->
</div>
<p class="text-justify">HelLites are magnanimous when it comes to birthdays; we smear one whole cake on the person’s face on birthdays. Thinking of GPLs? Don’t worry, you will have a good mix of GPL, eggs, cold water, cough syrup, and some secret ingredients (read surprise quizzes) hurled at you on birthdays.</p>
<h4>Night Mess:</h4><br>
<div class="blog-image-container">
  <img src="assets/images/MR.Bean gif.gif" class="blog-images"/>
</div>
<p class="text-justify"><br>The Annapurna Night mess, which runs till 3:00 am on regular days and till 4:00 am during exams, is absolute bliss. After a long and tiring day, a cup of cold coffee, a plate of Aloo paratha (laced with butter), and a fresh serving of pav bhaji heals the soul.</p>P.S: They serve Non-Veg too (Galouti Kebab is bae).<br><br>
<h4>Prom-Night:</h4><br>
<div class="blog-image-container">
  <img src="assets/images/Prom gif.gif" class="blog-images"/>
</div>
<p class="text-justify">Ladies and gentlemen, pack the best of your apparel. Prom-Night (who needs an explanation) is one hot-shot event to look up to. Wondering “Mera number kab aaega?”, lo aa gaya.</p>
<h4>TEDx:</h4><br>
<div class="blog-image-container">
  <img src="assets/images/Tedex.jpg" class="blog-images"/>
</div>
<p class="text-justify">Yes, you read it right. IIM Lucknow hosts TEDx on campus. So those fancy Facebook DP filters that you had always fancied will now be on your DP.

<div class="blog-image-container">

</div>
<p class="text-justify">It was one day before the cyclone hit us when I got to know about my selection at IIM Lucknow. I am still not sure why we were so excited and diligent about those anti-purgatory tasks. Maybe it was the hope of starting something good afresh.</p>
<span id="hometo-dots" style="display: inline; "></span><span id="hometo-more" style="display: none;text-align: justify;"> 
<p>
June 8, 2019, the day I entered the premises of Hel(L) - Had to miss my convocation and instead enroll in the preparatory course. Little did I know this place would break me, build me, and give me an unlimited share of memories and learnings. The sudden realisation that one has to compete with people who have already worked their asses off in the corporate world, who are from diverse backgrounds - CA, engineers, doctors, lawyers, sc. grads, it was scary and exciting at the same time.<br><br>
People already had their dream companies in their minds when you hadn't heard of many, not even once.<br><br>
However, there was something which didn't let the flames die. FOMO, rat race, stress was always there to eat you up, but it was the personal connections you made with people that helped survive the brutal reality. One may be a part of innumerable groups - section, CCA, regional, college, sports, projects, case competitions, parties, common interests but there would only be a few who could touch the chords of your heart. It is not just passing/acing through multiple exams/competitions which you learn, but it's how you cope up with challenges which matter, with people who matter, for a future which you believe is promising and satisfying. You fight, you lose, you get up, you struggle, you win - you might lose again but you are going to remember the part where you struggle because this is when you could read between the lines, you could realise the real well wishers, you could feel the potential you hold - in a nutshell, you grow to be even more powerful. When you start exploring, you would realize everyone is fighting their own battle. This is when one may start wondering how can one preserve his/her sanity amidst all of this? It's the hope. The hope that everything will fall in place at the end. Being part of the batch, which witnessed unanticipated conditions due to the pandemic, I could surely comment that don't ever stop believing in yourself. It never hurts to stay hopeful :)<br><br>

<div class="blog-image-container">

</div>
<p class="text-justify">20th May 2021 was a usual day for me; I was on a work call sharing updates from my day with my teammates, until suddenly my phone started vibrating non-stop with the barrage of texts on the several Telegram groups that I was a part of (so that I don’t miss out on any interview experience xD) that IIM Lucknow’s first list was out!  My anxiety soared heights I didn’t know it could. I told my teammates that I needed a break, opened Lucknow’s website only to stare at Error 404 – Not Found, I was perplexed, is this a glitch, am I rejected, not even waitlisted? </p>
<span id="magic-dots" style="display: inline; "></span><span id="magic-more" style="display: none;text-align: justify;"> 
<p>


Was I going to settle with only one search?  Obviously not! I hit refreshed multiple times but my heart kept sinking lower and lower.<br><br>
Suddenly, someone on one of those hyperactive Telegram groups pinged, “guys add student_home after the portal link”, high on anxiety, I hastily added the extension but juggling between my phone and laptop, I dropped my laptop!<br><br>
 
You see, even before my MBA had started I got my first learning – “Be Patient”<br><br>
I took a deep breath…. picked up my Laptop, quickly typed out the link again, and entered my credentials, and BAM!! There it was...I didn’t believe it at the first sight; I am not someone who celebrates too soon. I thought, “Is this an error?” I scanned the page 3-4 times before I let the message sink in…<br><br>
“Congratulations! You have been offered Provisional Admission to the below-mentioned programme(s) of IIM Lucknow (Batch 2021-23).”<br><br>
That was my moment of receiving the Hogwarts letter.
My dream of 4 years had been realized, those long nights where I would write a mock after logging off post-midnight from the office, replacing my lunch-time Netflix sessions with YouTube videos on DILR concepts and the constant anxiety of cracking CAT and getting through those gruelling interviews had come to fruition. This journey has definitely not been an easy one. From someone who had no plans of pursuing a post-grad to someone who post the second year of undergrad realized that he wasn’t cut out for engineering, I dreamt of getting only into the top 7 B-schools of India. I wanted to clear CAT in my final year of UG but I realized, I wouldn’t make the most of my MBA if I go into a B-school without having actually explored the corporate world. I got that opportunity at ZS Associates, the challenging work and long hours did pose a barrier to my dreams of achieving a great percentile, but I was hell-bent on it. During my preparation I lost track of my sleep, I would start studying when my parents would go to sleep and I would go to my bed when they woke up in the morning. I would try to find even the smallest of gaps during the day when I had office, where I could read up on something that might help me in the preparation. Even after doing all this, a month before CAT, I wasn’t performing well in mocks, sometimes I would mess up my DILR, and sometimes I would very confidently tick all the incorrect options in VARC. The stress & breakdown was real. I started dreading mocks.  After a few days of introspection and with the support of my friends & family, it dawned upon me, that scoring well in mocks isn’t my destination but to crack the CAT.<br><br>
But the CAT exam packed a surprise in itself. A huge blunder that my DILR was, I started assessing the probability of writing CAT again next year, but to my respite, I belled the CAT with a 99.62 %ile and gave my all into preparing for the interviews despite being tested COVID positive a month before my interviews.<br><br>
I aced my interviews and in July’2021 I will be joining the PGP-37 Batch of Hel(L).<br><br>
Hoping my time at L is as magic-hel(L) as it was of Harry’s at Hogwarts!

<h2 class="blog-title mt-4 mb-2">A story of persistence and rising above mediocrity - Mitashi Agarwal</h2>
<div class="blog-image-container">

</div>
<p class="text-justify">Dreams do come true. I cannot relate to it more than I can now. Studying in one of the prestigious management institutes of the country is the goal of many but only a handful of them succeed. Coming from a tier 3 city I received mediocre schooling and no external academic support. I had to travel 50 kms both ways in a local bus to get my schooling done. With my own efforts and hardwork, I was able to secure the position of district topper in class XII. It was a proud moment for me and my family as I was able to do so well without any support.</p>
<span id="persis-dots" style="display: inline; "></span><span id="persis-more" style="display: none;text-align: justify;"> 
<p>
I took a year break to prepare for JEE but unfortunately could not crack it and instead ended up in a state government college. Those days were threatening for me as I thought it to be the end of my career. Being a spectator to my mother’s and father’s struggle has made me realise that not in failure itself, but in failure to try lies the weakness. Unblemished effort will always carry you towards your goal. Thereafter, I never looked back and explored the opportunities which I had in hand to get the best out of it. When I started my preparation for CAT, I was not very confident that I would end up being part of one of the elite institutes. As the preparation gained momentum, my performance in mocks followed a sinusoidal path thrashing my confidence even more as I reached the trough of my performance curve. Failure hit me again as I scored 95 percentile and did not get calls from any old IIMs. I felt low but had the faith that I will come back stronger. <br><br>
After that I began my corporate life in work from home mode. Working from home saved me a lot of time which I devoted to my preparation. Again, my scores were very fluctuating in mocks. I was performing terribly in verbal and no matter how hard I try, how sincerely I analyse the mocks or how much essays I read my scores were degrading in that section. Clouds of frustration and disappointment surrounded me every time but the only good thing I did was to keep going and not lose hope no matter what. Even one week before the CAT, I was not able to clear the cut-off of verbal in mocks and it was making me shudder from inside. I gathered all my courage and confidence and without thinking about the consequences I went for the exam banking on QA (my strongest section). I did a huge blunder in my exam which I realized when the exam analysis started flooding out. Being over confident I did not fill the forms of any other exams except IIFT and unfortunately I was not able to attempt IIFT because of some unforeseen situation. So the only thing in hand was CAT. Then came the results and I scored 98.73 percentile. Seeing the result, I was not very happy but without wasting any time I diverted all my energy for the interview preparation whole heartedly. IIM Lucknow was my best call and I had to convert it by hook or by crook. <br><br>
After a roller coaster ride of about one year managing studies and work together, the hell-bent attitude finally paid off and fighting against all odds I am here today part of one of the most coveted institutes of the country competing with some of the best minds. All the credits for whatever I have achieved and wherever I am today goes to my parents who have always supported and trusted me. Earlier I used to be obsessed with perfection and order and wanted to excel in everything and this instilled a fear of failure inside me but this journey has made me realize that failure is the stepping stone towards success. Your job throughout your entire life is to disappoint as many people as it takes to avoid disappointing yourself. Give your dreams your all and life will reward you with nothing but the best. <br><br>

A computer was born to solve problems, but it creates so many hurdles in the life of
a Computer Science Engineer. The same it did with me!. Though the graduation was
about zeros and ones, gradually, I realized that it’s about making memories, hanging
out with friends, hopping at various cafes, and roaming around for no reason and
then the nostalgic farewell phase of the college started.<br><br>
“Don’t cry because it’s over, smile because it happened”- this quote by Dr. Suss has
helped me to embark on a new journey with Larsen & Toubro Infotech in the year
twenty-eighteen. Meetings with new people, engaging with several clients, and
working as an SAP Consultant has opened new doors of learning for me and driven
me to get a holistic view of different business processes. With this passion, I
boarded the flight of CAT and landed at HelL.<br><br>
Along with the job, I’ve traveled to so many places nearby Pune and Mumbai.
Salubrious climate, magnificent exquisiteness, historical forts, ancient caves, and
beautiful lakes used to be the craved destinations for me and my friends. The road
trips from green hills and lush valleys passing through mountains, beaches, and
countryside always helped to rejuvenate the group.<br><br>

In my free time that I’ll not get in the coming two years probably, I enjoy murmuring
old Hindi songs and lyrical album music. I also like to do contemporary dancing
though the area is new to me. From my childhood, I firmly believe that the belly rules
the mind. This frame of mind and being a native of Indore provided me enormous
chances to try different cuisines but still waiting for the time to try Galoti kababs.

<h2 class="blog-title mt-4 mb-2">THE POWER OF DAYDREAMING – A CA’s JOURNEY TO ‘IIM L’ - Debolina Gupta</h2>
<div class="blog-image-container">
<img src="assets/images/articles/debolinagupta1.jpg" class="blog-images"/>
</div>
<p class="text-justify">Have you ever closed your eyes and wandered endlessly in your own world of make-believe??
</p>
<span id="daydream-dots" style="display: inline; "></span><span id="daydream-more" style="display: none;text-align: justify;"> 
<p>
Hi! I am Debolina. A chartered accountant by profession but dreamer by religion. <br><br>
 
I was 8 when my father retired from the Indian Navy introducing me to the outside world. It was a visit to his new office when I caught a glimpse of the colossal cabin opposite his.<br><br>
 
"What's that?”, I asked, to which my father said “That's the MD’s office.” <br><br>
 
The innocent counter question "Who is that?" <br><br>
 
Imagine my father’s plight trying to explain the role of an MD to a little child. Regardless, the palatial room had already taken me to dreamland. <br><br>
 
That day I remember rummaging through my box of erasers looking for the letters “M & D”. Once I had found them, I tucked them away safely in a small box innocently treasuring my dream. <br><br>
 
Fast forward almost a decade! I grew interested in the world of finance to finally pursue CA. It was February 2019 just two months away from my final exams and 14 hours of planned effective studies had turned into daydreaming sessions. Reminiscing the past when days were rough and imagining the future if I didn't sail through were the most featured films during these times. <br><br>
 
Amidst all these thoughts, that I believe almost all CA aspirants go through, an image flashed through my head. <br><br>
 
Yes! That splendid room! And that room belonged to me! <br><br>
 
I said to myself, “You don’t have to see the whole staircase, just take the first step! Even if you stumble, you’re still moving forward”<br><br>

I revived my perseverant self; I had taken the first step towards realising my dream and now I proudly prefix the letters “CA” ahead of my name.<br><br>
 
Having achieved one milestone, I moved to the next. It was time to add the MBA feather to my cap. <br><br>
 
After working for a year, I decided to sit back, take a break and chalk out my life ahead. My colleagues and seniors were all really supportive throughout. <br><br>
 
After a lot of imagination, contemplation and research, I prepped for 2 months rigorously to appear for CAT in November 2020. <br><br>
 
The next couple of months were strenuous yet exciting. From receiving calls, preparing, to ultimately sitting through the interviews, it was a memorable experience. Weighing all the options I had, literally every conversation, ended with me saying “All I want is to get through IIM Lucknow”.<br><br>
 
Whenever pessimistic thoughts flooded my mind, I visualised my future self at IIM and spent time building castles in the air. I really felt positive illusions created by me drove away the negativity.<br><br>
 
It was already the first week of May and I was eagerly waiting for the results. Reading through random groups to stalking the institute websites to even rereading emails, the anxiety was for real.<br><br>
 
20th May 2021- “Results are out!!” Since the time this statement was made, complete mayhem broke out. From mom trying to access results on her phone to dad rewiring the wi-fi box and me refreshing my laptop and phone at the same time, it still cracks me up!<br><br>
 
After a show of all the technological powers, my screen finally displayed 
“Congratulations! You have been offered………”<br><br>
 
My tradition of daydreaming dates back years ago. I felt the power of imaginative teleportation while purchasing my first eraser. Now, a collection of 1200+, I showcase them through my Instagram page titled “The Deleophile”. Just two weeks ago, while putting together erasers for a post on my new page, I stumbled upon that tiny box which treasured my dream. I smiled and tucked it back in to hop onto this roller coaster of events that would shape a new me.

Words made my heart leap with joy (after a stressful hour of struggling to open the website). After months of hard work, I was going to get an MBA in addition to the tag of CA I achieved 2 years back. Before I could announce my victory to a third person, my cell phone rang. A call from my manager was enough to make me stop jumping and sit down. Post an hour call, wherein I controlled myself from resigning multiple times, I thought about the time I started this journey to Hel(L).

</p>
<span id="choices-dots" style="display: inline; "></span><span id="choices-more" style="display: none;text-align: justify;"> 
<p>
June 2020: - Jaded from my routine, an opportunity to give CAT struck my mind. Naturally, post SRCC and CA, there was pressure from all fronts to aim for the Holy trinity. A lot of opinions came my way- it’s too late to start, isn’t CA a masters in itself, etc. I turned a blind eye to all –the Rosa (Brooklyn nine nine) in me told me to focus on achieving my dream. I created buckets for all tasks and planned each task in a manner that would put Monica (Friends) to shame. However, the day of my result, I ended up spending 2 hours hurled up in my bed, crying as I did not achieve my expected score. Words of motivation turned into “It’s ok” and I started dreaming of a different future than before.<br><br>
A few days later, my heart almost skipped a beat looking at the subject line of the email- Admissions IIML. My joy knew no bounds as I celebrated getting shortlisted for one of the premier institutes of the country. With great zeal and vigor, I began prepping for the interview process. Surprises were not over for me. A few days later, I received a shortlist from IIMB. It was now time to bring in the big guns and channelize my inner Hermione (Harry Potter). <br><br>
The day of the interview, shaking, I joined the zoom call. But the people in front of me, apparently profs from Hel(L) seemed like saints to me- they were polite, they smiled, engaged in healthy discussion on each point- and in my heart, I fell in love a little with the institute. That day I couldn’t stop smiling. I was dancing after days of frustration, I was smiling again. Knowing well in my heart, my parents treated it like a prep for IIMB. “Ok it's just a little crush” I thought, “it will go away”.<br><br>
My stress was at penultimate for IIMB as I sat down to take the most important zoom call of my life. Thankfully, I did not throw an Alex (Modern family-had a nervous breakdown before SATs). 25 minutes later, the call ended, but the smile on my face and beaming confidence like a week back was somehow missing. I convinced myself to apply the Secret and hope for the best.<br><br>
A few days later, while scrolling through Instagram, I saw a photograph of IIM L campus and my heart skipped a beat. So much so, I could not get those images out of my head for days and the song “Kuch to hua hai '' played on repeat in my mind. I used to daydream, and could not sleep. The butterflies in my stomach told me I had been hit with the Cupid’s arrow. But for all I knew, my parents’ hopes were pinned on B.<br><br>
The results came. And a rude shock awaited me, as for the first time in my life I faced rejection. The next one week was hard. Other acceptances didn’t feel so good and my whole confidence took a downturn. But 20th May, 2021 invoked life back in me. They say you find love in a hopeless place- for me it found me on the day I was most hopeless, and uplifted me into a world of dreams and happiness. It was not easy to convince my parents who were hell bent they had chosen B for me. But for them, my happiness mattered the most. Like Babuji got convinced by Raj’s efforts for Simran, my father looked into my eyes and said, “Go Shreya…. Live your life…. And I ran with the acceptance form in my hand, running behind the car. It was time to get in the car, to meet my friends and give a party for the rewards I had reaped. <br><br>
Sometimes, love finds you in the most unexpected times from the most unexpected places. You may find a person who seems like an accurate fit in all senses, is perfect, your parents love him/her. But your heart craves for compatibility, friendship and bonding. And just like Ted found Robin, Michael Scott found Holly, Humpty found Kavya- I found my lobster- Hel(L). Now that I have fallen in love, it’s time to hold my claws with Hel(L) together, and walk around with the lifetime tag for “HelLite”.

<p class="text-justify">“Be careful what you wish for, you may get it.” <br><br>
These lines sparked across my mind as I refreshed my g-mail around five minutes past 3 o’clock in anticipation of getting an admission offer from one of the best B-Schools in India. I felt emotional. I could not believe as is the case with many but this had come after a long long wait of about a month and after a series of heartbreaks in every consecutive offer list. I hurried to check the admission portal just to confirm the same. All of this happened while I was in a queue waiting for my turn to get vaccinated.

<span id="performing-dots" style="display: inline; "></span><span id="performing-more" style="display: none;text-align: justify;"> 
<p>
I felt numb. I was happy. But more than that I felt that I was alive at that very moment. That was one of the best moments of my life, if not the best. <br><br>
“From performing street plays and singing and witnessing pro shows at IIM L to finally getting an admission - it has been a Hel(L) of a ride” <br><br>

IIM Lucknow is very close to my heart since my second year of undergrad ( 2 years before getting admission to IIML). At the time of jotting this down - I am still pursuing my Computer Science Engineering from Institute of Engineering Technology (IET), Lucknow which is 10 minutes away from IIML and was founded in the same year as IIML, in 1984. The reason why IIML is special is that it has witnessed some of the finest moments of my life - I was one of the finalists in the IIML’s Business, Cultural, and Sports fest - Manfest Varchasva’s Sur( Solo Singing Competition) and had performed in Street Play competitions organized by IIML at one of the remote villages in Lucknow. <br><br>
I have witnessed the likes of Vishal-Shekhar, Guru Randhawa, and many EDM nights with the people that became a part of my life - my college friends. <br><br>
I could not win the singing competition but my College’s Drams Team (IET Josh) has won for straight 10 years in Street play competitions at IIML’s Manfest Varchasva. Being the Cultural Head of the institute and having managed a lot of events myself, I was fascinated with the way they handled the events on such a large scale. I have been to IIML several times and the place inspired me to go for the CAT exam. <br><br>
The pandemic times were tough and when I saw my friends getting placements gave me a lot of anxiety and my whole life would appear to be a waste as my colleagues were crazy with coding and stuff and all I could do at that time was RCs and DILR sets. <br><br>

Meditation and yoga helped me a lot to focus and calmed my anxiety in the difficult covid times - when the whole world lost their nearer ones, a real testing time for the aspirants.<br><br>
The mock tests and my mentors helped me throughout my journey. And the seniors at my college, my friends who supported me enough, and finally my family who always believed in me and never ever let me give thought to "what if I don't get admission this year" I always believed in the process and the will to get better every-day has made all the difference. <br><br>
“The journey to IIM L has been on several occasions seemed to be full of chance events” <br><br>
My academics played a major role in getting me a call and sometimes I feel it was just a matter of luck that Admission Office(at IIML) picked my phone at 5 pm to get my document verification done as I was way off my slot on the document verification day as I had my university-exams on the same day. I had to rush to my hostel for the verification leaving my exam hall 45 minutes before the exam completion time- who knows what would have happened if I would have missed my document verification. Also, I was lucky enough to get a PI just the next day of my Undergrad Exam. <br><br>
After all, this is just the beginning of a different and bigger league, not just the 2 years of MBA but the life that awaits is full of challenges. <br><br>

But no matter what I achieve during my time at Hel(L) -“whenever I will stroll down the corridors and the beautiful pathways- full of flowers across the lane, I will always reminisce of the beautiful times that I spent there.”

<h2 class="blog-title mt-4 mb-2">My Dream of Saving the World ! - Yash Sagar</h2>
<div class="blog-image-container">
<img src="assets/images/articles/yashsagar1.jpg" class="blog-images"/>
</div>
<p class="text-justify">From childhood onwards, I was told to "Always Dream Big". Like a kid is fascinated by superheroes, I was fascinated by the top businessmen.
 I always saw them as a changemaker, and them having the power to bring a revolution.
 Saving the world or changing the world was something that has always intrigued me! And therefore, I always dreamt of something like saving the world by Making A Positive Difference in society.</p>
<span id="mydreams-dots" style="display: inline; "></span><span id="mydreams-more" style="display: none;text-align: justify;"> 
<p>
Businesses, for a long time, have influenced the world and made an impact on the lives of people. In India, be it JIO or the IT industry, businesses have generated a myriad number of jobs directly or indirectly. That's the power of business, it has the potential to improve the lives of several people!<br><br>
So, I started stepping towards the business world. I aspired to do MBA from a top b-school as it was a very important milestone in order to understand how the business world works. That’s how my whole MBA journey began.<br><br>
I started preparing for entrance exams and just like other students who were preparing for CAT, I too faced a lot of ups and downs during my preparation. Failures were like a constant companion and VARC was a nightmare! Looking at every mock score was like feeling an arrow getting pierced through the heart but believe me if your dedication is genuine and hard work is real then you will definitely reap the benefits.<br><br>
It was the 2nd January 2021, when a whole year's hard work showed some positive results. Though my percentile was not enough to get the calls from the flagship PGP program of old IIMs, the holy BLACKI, and yes, I am a GEM. But still, I was able to get an interview call from PGP in Sustainable Management program of IIM Lucknow. Getting an interview call from PGP-SM, and understanding what the program is all about, made me remember the dream of mine saving the world making a positive impact in the lives of people!<br><br>
The more I read about this course and its vision, the more I got interested in this course. Sustainable Management, unlike normal general management, looks at a business problem in a more holistic manner. Not just the environment, SM also gives importance to the people in the society without compromising with the profits of a company. It has a plethora of opportunities in finance, consulting, marketing and operations.<br><br>
Therefore, I took my interview preparation very seriously. I guess I have given a mock interview each day in the month of February. My interview was scheduled on 2nd March. I also talked to the seniors of SM and asked them about the course. They were very helpful and gave me pretty good insights which helped me ace the interview.<br><br>

Finally, we all know climate change is real and businesses today are struggling to reach their sustainability targets, hence I think that the time is ripe to take up the course and contribute my skills towards business as well as society at large. I have a strong belief that even if I am able to bring a change of just 0.00000001%, I Can Make A Difference!<br><br>

<h2 class="blog-title mt-4 mb-2">How volunteering for a cause changed me - Naman Sagar</h2>
<div class="blog-image-container">
<img src="assets/images/articles/namansagar.jpg" class="blog-images"/>
</div>
<p class="text-justify">During my college days in Vellore, I was walking outside the campus with my friends and saw some homeless children begging for alms. I gave them some money and asked them how they were. My Tamil speaking friend translated the response of one child — “I wish I could have a life like you all.”</p>
<span id="volunteer-dots" style="display: inline; "></span><span id="volunteer-more" style="display: none;text-align: justify;"> 
<p>

This statement made a deep impact on me. I gathered information about the NGOs in the vicinity and joined a student-led initiative which aimed to impart quality education to children in orphanages. We visited the children during weekends and taught them elementary English and Maths in a unique and interactive way. Never had I imagined the joy I could experience by delighting these children who did not have much to be glad about. It was heartwarming for me to become a popular and welcome visitor for them and see their enthusiasm in showing me their art and craftwork. A shy little girl would hide behind her caregiver when I initially visited. Later on, she would eagerly await my arrival because I got her a chocolate every time I came.<br><br>

Volunteering changed me in a lot of ways. It humbled me and made me more sensitive to societal issues. It made me realize that emotion ignites passion, which can, in turn, help you achieve anything you set out to do. I also discovered that language barriers can be broken through props, artistic methods and sign language.<br><br>

I believe that while several of us invest in good causes monetarily, the value of our personal presence through volunteering is much more. There is a lot that we can do as individuals to fight the social challenges faced by our country and should definitely look for avenues and make time to do so.

<h2 class="blog-title mt-4 mb-2">Oh well, it’s helL -  Pavni Jain</h2>
<div class="blog-image-container">

</div>
<p class="text-justify">This Journey started in March 2019. I was working for the past 5 months in the IT industry. I got used to all ongoing projects, basically, I was about to enter my comfort zone when the question struck that something else needs to be done for my career. Out of the multiple options available, one of the most common was to switch the job but I planned something else, i.e., MBA. </p>
<span id="ohwell-dots" style="display: inline; "></span><span id="ohwell-more" style="display: none;text-align: justify;"> 
<p>

While thinking about it, I went on multiple trips with friends and family, thinking later I might not get time. Soon after the decision, I started reading about all, that is required to study for the CAT exam. The first book I downloaded was of quant from a famous author. Then I gathered courage which itself took a week to open the book. After completing a basic chapter, I realized that soft copy won't help me in a long run. So, I begin researching from where can I purchase a complete course. I bought one and started watching the lectures. Soon after a week, while chit-chatting with two of my colleagues at the office, I found out that one of them was also preparing for the CAT exam. We discussed how is the preparation going and what strategy is being applied for such a short span. After discussion, we decided to collaborate for study, as I had read in the study that studying with different people will increase the productivity of both by ~40%.<br><br>
 
The very next day he bought a book and we started studying together. We used to read the topic and worked on exercise at home. Meanwhile, I got shifted to a different team and had to undergo all the training and start with the basics. It got tough to take out time but I tried my best to manage it. Eventually, we completed the quant by mid-August. While this time I also started reading the Hindu editorials for my VARC section. Soon after quant, we switched to the logical section. The book we had for logical was pretty easy and it didn't give a glimpse of difficulty level, we completed logical within a month. After that, we started VARC, and again the same thing happened. We didn’t finish VARC, and in between, my friend mentioned that it is very important to give a mock test before CAT. I searched about it and found the same, as time was less for the exam, so we had to do smart study and gain maximum knowledge in less time, so, we purchased one mock test series. Then we gave mock and analysed them to the best, soon after one test we opted for another. This went on till CAT 2019 came closer. In between, I filled very few college forms, from the little knowledge I had. At that time in CAT, my weakest section was VARC, which I figured out during mocks. The D-day came and I gave the exam. Soon after the exam, I started going on trips that were pending for around 6 months. The result came in January and I remember I was at my friends' outlet when I saw my percentile and got completely shattered. I got into the zone of what is next what will happen now.<br><br>
 
I talked to my friend with whom I used to study and decided to opt again and go for offline classes. Then after some discussion, we enrolled in the month of February. The office workload was also increasing. Then in March, lockdown happened which proved to be good for me, as I was able to focus only on preparation and avoided going out with friends for long. This time, I filled multiple forms, appeared for CAT, and scored better. Then came interviews, I started getting revolved around current affairs, jotted down some common questions. The day came when I had to give IIML interview. I remember that way too many technical questions were asked, and after the interview, I wasn't happy. I thought I won't be able to make it. Then results started coming and I paid the amount in multiple colleges before I made it in IIML in the fourth list. Getting here was the happiest day like all the hard work of 2 years paid off, the happiness and feeling of accomplishment like I completed a trek of 15000 ft height.<br><br>

<h2 class="blog-title mt-4 mb-2">If experiences made you rich, I'd be a billionaire already:D - Varsha Janardhan</h2>
<div class="blog-image-container">
<img src="assets/images/articles/varshajanardhan.jpg" class="blog-images"/>
</div>
<p class="text-justify">It was an ordinary afternoon with below-average weather when I stroked my fringes back and
thought to myself that it was time I had changed my job - did something meaningful - something
that made a difference in the world. The year is 2018. The summer season was about to end, or
so I thought. I was sitting in my bog-standard cubicle, listlessly scrolling through my mailbox as
though for a godsend realization about what I wanted to do with my life.</p>
<span id="rich-dots" style="display: inline; "></span><span id="rich-more" style="display: none;text-align: justify;"> 
<p>
Whatever I had always wanted to have - a decently paying job, making parents proud, all that -
had been rendered meaningless in this moment of futility. Myriad conversations with peers and
a couple of TED talks later, it came to me that the intersection of my passions and skill sets, as
visualised on a Venn Diagram, lay in my doing an MBA. With more investigation and other
calculations, I decided to take the ever-dreaded CAT exam. I put all my eggs in the CAT's
basket and started my preparation with rigour, except I failed and my reality was wiped out.<br><br>
That's when I started to look inward and pay attention to my mental health. After spending
more-than-necessary time recovering from this shudder, I started preparing for the exam again,
trying not to be too hard on myself this time, making some space for self-love and care, and the
people around me, and looking at alternatives if I was to fall flat again. However, it took me a
while before I could fathom the fact that I was not going to realise the dream I had been building
for a year and a half - of getting into IIM Bangalore. A few CAT mock tests in the initial months
boosted my confidence to a point of complacency. On the other hand, there were a lot of trials
and errors in my ongoing treatment and medication for anxiety and depression. Eventually, CAT
2019 ended up being as good as CAT 2018, or just as bad. As a justification to myself, I
perpetually urged my brain to think that I had been focusing on my emotional health that year,
which had not been any better anyway. Here I stood, back to where I started, feeling dumb and
numb, thinking that the coming year was a do-or-die chance.<br><br>
With help from a friend who was well versed with the GMAT, I first aimed for ISB, whose admission process would get over just before the CAT exam. With a plan in place this time - one
with a safety net, I had started once again. Even though the ISB admission process did get over before the CAT exam, it was not over for me - I was waitlisted. With a more comforting
performance in CAT 2020 than that of the previous attempts, I gifted myself a course by Jay
Shetty - Live Your Passion, Build An Income.<br><br>
The year is 2021 and I am thinking that I have to give it my all and convert the IIM Bangalore
interview call into an admit. My inner circle who had seen me struggle all these years was sure
that I would get into IIM Bangalore this year. Even I had been quite certain until my reality was
once again broken and I was not even waitlisted in the college. I don't know what went wrong,
it's probably my shaky typing skills and lack of general awareness, but I have moved on now.
Jay Shetty says and I quote 'everything that doesn't happen to me is saving me time.' That's
what struck me before accepting admission from IIM Lucknow. I converted all the IIM interview
calls into admits (I didn't get called by A and C) except that of Bangalore. Even though it is hard
to digest, if I look at this as an opportunity rather than regret, I have some valuable lessons to
take away from this journey - even more valuable than an admit from the topmost Business
School in the country.

<p class="text-justify">Hii everyone, I’m Tanvi Maheshwari from Nathdwara, a small town, near Udaipur, Rajasthan.
The picture here isn’t just a picture. It’s so special for me.
It was clicked on 2nd of January 2021.The day, CAT results came out and it was my birthday
too... (Told you so special).I scored 99.57 percentile and I was getting bundle of wishes and
congratulations. It shows the height I’ve reached. Oh from height I must tell you I'm
4'11.(shorter than average) And yes I've been bullied so many times for this. (Don't mind it
now).

<span id="peak-dots" style="display: inline; "></span><span id="peak-more" style="display: none;text-align: justify;"> 
<p>
All this sounds so simple yet it isn't. Like everyone's mine too include pits and falls. My CATjourney started in 2019. Unfortunately with all the effort I put in, from deactivating social
media accounts to restraining myself from parties, I landed upon 93.01 percentile with a 78
percentile in VARC. So, I wasn't even able to get calls from baby and new IIMS. I was in my final year without a job because the one I had, I didn't join that for CAT and then Corona happened.
My relatives started taunting my parents “Engineering karwa ke kya kar lia”, “tell her to join any
company”, “ Itta padha ke kya karoge” and all.My parents weren't forcing me but yet it was
difficult to face those comments.I decided that I'll write CAT 2020.I had no idea and didn't even
bother to think about what percentile I would get. I just prepared and prepared. Results came
out then, and everything was changed.<br><br>
I got calls from all the IIMs. I prepared for interviews I got rejected by IIM A and waitlisted by IIM
B and C. Those were very tough 2-3 days till the results of other B-schools came out because I had no hope that I would convert IIM-L; my interview was that bad. But yes, at it is said, you
cannot judge your interview results. I converted all the upcoming colleges. I was not even
willing to see the results of L, because the flashes of interviews were playing in a loop. It
showed either you have entered incorrect details or you are rejected in the first attempt. I
rechecked. I just read “Congratulations…” and my hands started shivering. I rechecked the
results 3 more times.<br><br>
Now, I had a new dilemma to choose between FMS Delhi and IIM L and after a lot of research
and somewhat inclined to L, I chose it.<br><br>
Still, I cannot believe I made it to IIM-L, still feels like a dream or a fairy tale, being from a place
where people might not know what IIML is.

</div>
<p class="text-justify">“It’s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting.”<br><br>
Hailing from a modest background, I started my education at a Hindi medium school;
I switched to an English medium school in class X, Which was difficult as each change we go
through leaves many learnings behind it. I grew confident as a part of my efforts to interact &
assimilate from my peers.

</p>
<span id="dreams-dots" style="display: inline; "></span><span id="dreams-more" style="display: none;text-align: justify;"> 
<p>
This makeshift in the ductile character exposed me to many activities such as Abstract
painting, cooking, and playing the guitar. I started to participate in every possible event, which
resulted in immense interest in programming, football & photography. I learned languages such
as C, C++, Python, and drafting software AutoCAD & Creo. Being good with Mathematics
since childhood, I gave home tuitions for class XII Mathematics, and I was able to self-finance
my education and secured admission to MBM Engineering College.
In engineering, I volunteered for multiple college cultural events. I also got an
opportunity to lead a group of nine students in my final year project. I thoroughly enjoyed
managing my time among teaching, events, and academics. My family was happy that I
achieved the second rank in my batch and a job at the mining & natural resources MNC
(Vedanta).<br><br>
<img src="assets/images/articles/niteshmishra2.jpg" class="blog-images"/><br><br>
My tenure at BALCO (A subsidiary of Vedanta) was an enjoyable and enriching
experience. I got selected to work in the planning and management office (PMO) as a technical
assistant to the SBU head and Lead-PMO. This Deputation gave me a platform to analyze SBU
statistics and represent them to senior management to help them make business decisions.
<br><br>
These two years at BALCO presented me with an opportunity to work with the CXO-
level executives, which helped me to understand the overall business from a broader
<br><br>

perspective. It encouraged me to pursue an M.B.A to learn the nuances & have scientific
exposure towards management.
After the COVID-19 pandemic, I had to leave my job. I took this as a challenge. I came
home and started preparing for my second attempt at CAT. It was not easy managing studies
while my brother and uncle tested covid positive. I kept my composure in all these situations
and continued my studies. My determination bore fruit in January when results were declared.
I received shortlists from multiple IIMs and other premier institutes. My dream was to get
admission into one out of the top ten business schools of India.<br><br>
The month of May brought the convert results, and with each announced list, my
anxiety level was increasing. I was on the waitlist for Lucknow, Indore, and Shillong. Finally,
the moment arrived on the First of June, 2021. I secured admission to the coveted Indian
Institute of Management Lucknow for their Post Graduate Program in Management.

</div>
<p class="text-justify">It all started on June 30th, 2020. The day marked the completion of one year of the formal training period. I was working from home due to Covid restrictions in my society. But there was a hidden excitement running through my heart. A message beeped on the Whatsapp group of all trainees. ‘HR has called for a meet’. I spent the next hour speculating what might be happening in the meet and then another message beeped. ‘No delicate way to say this. All GETs have been sacked from the job’.

</p>
<span id="walkingthru-dots" style="display: inline; "></span><span id="walkingthru-more" style="display: none;text-align: justify;"> 
<p>
Sometimes what happens in a matter of few seconds can change the course of your whole life. For me, it was this moment. The day I was expecting the increment letter, I lost my job due to Covid.<br><br>
I hadn’t expected even in my wildest thoughts what was happening to me. I would be lying if say it didn’t affect me badly. But then, friends and family don’t let you lose so easily. It was already the last week of August. With not many alternatives left to choose from, I filled the form a day before the deadline. At that moment, if anyone had told me, “Don’t worry, in less than a year you may be sitting in IIM Lucknow; I would have laughed at the sheer audacity of their thoughts.”<br><br>
Anyways with nothing to lose mindset; I started my preparation for CAT. I had less than three months. So I focused on solving and analyzing as many mocks as I could and didn’t pay much attention to the results.<br><br>
The D Day of the CAT was approaching. But even then, I didn’t have much hope. And then came the last night before the exam. I could not sleep for a single minute that whole night. I left early and reached the center well before the time. The exam happened and I returned home without thinking much about how it went. The only thought which was coming to my mind was ‘I could have done better.’<br><br>
The result of the CAT was published in early Jan’21. I got 97.62 %ile. By the third week of January, I had calls from IIM B, IIML, IIMK, IIMI, and all new IIMs. That is when I started my interview preparations diligently.<br><br>
My first interview was scheduled for 25th Feb of IIMB. The excitement and nervousness were somewhere beyond the seventh sky and no wonder I ruined it. It lasted around half-hour and I just couldn’t handle the pressure. I saw my best opportunity going to ruins. But then I consoled myself that probably the worst has passed.<br><br>
To keep me busy without worrying much about the interviews, I left my home once again to join a startup in Delhi NCR. I kept my preparations for the interview along with that. The interview of IIM Lucknow was scheduled for the 15th of March. I had heard people discussing on telegram groups that their interview lasted only 8 to 10 minutes so definitely, I was nervous.<br><br>
The interview started at around 2:40 pm and lasted for 20 minutes. It was the most unexpected one
where no questions related to my work ex or academics were asked. Instead, it was more sort of a
discussion around the Indian constitution, government policies and, judiciary system. I answered
most of the questions and the panel seemed satisfied by the end.<br><br>

All the interviews got over by late April and now the wait for results started. I was somehow more
fortunate to convert NITIE in the first week of May itself. I converted IIM I and IIM S but got
direct reject from IIM B and IIM K in the next week.<br><br>
Then it all came down to the result of IIM Lucknow. It was published in the late evening on 20th May.
I was on the close waitlist and was somehow sure of converting it in subsequent lists. The wait was
finally over on the 7th of June. I got the admission offer from IIM Lucknow. Suddenly everything I
went through last year seemed part of a bigger plan for me. If things hadn’t gone that bad, maybe I
could never reach where I am today.<br><br>
Life will probably bring more ups and downs for me in the future but for now, I take pride in my
journey. And I am determined to make most of the next two years at IIM Lucknow. ‘Life does give you second chances; you just need to be ready when the right time comes.’

<h2 class="blog-title mt-4 mb-2">I had a dream - Rahul Daluka</h2>
<div class="blog-image-container">

</div>
<p class="text-justify">I am Rahul Daluka, graduated from SRCC, I am a Chartered Accountant, and have cleared all three
levels of CFA. I have worked in investment banking with Deloitte for almost 3 years. Having seen my
cousins and college seniors graduate from B-schools and the way it transformed their life and
personalities, I planned to pursue CAT during the 4 th semester of under-graduation.

</p>
<span id="hadadream-dots" style="display: inline; "></span><span id="hadadream-more" style="display: none;text-align: justify;"> 
<p class="text-justify">
 However, the
Almighty had other plans for me at that time. I was pursuing an internship as my project submission
for final year of college, where my experienced mentor advised me to finish CA first as it requires
rigorous training, and that one can make the most of MBA after getting some work experience in the
corporate world. This made sense to me, and I dropped my b-school entrance preparations to focus
on CA.<br><br>
<h4>The Failure</h4><br>
After under-graduation, I completed articleship training, qualified as a CA and started working with
Deloitte. Once I completed one year at work, I felt it was the right time for me start preparing for
CAT. I enrolled for CAT 2019 and started preparing alongside the full-time job. When the results
were declared, I found that my dream would have to wait longer before coming true. The score I had
managed was not good enough to get me a shortlist from any of the top IIMs. I had just one
interview call from a reputed institute, however, I decided against that and planned to appear for
CAT again.<br><br>
<h4>The Success</h4><br>
Equipped with the learnings from the previous attempt, I started my preparation early for CAT 2020.
One of the biggest mistakes I made in CAT 2019 was that I did not practice regularly and studied
mainly towards the end. I made sure not to repeat the same mistake. However, 2020 brought
different set of challenges with it. The home became the place of work and boundaries of personal
and professional time faded at a great pace. The increased uncertainty of future instilled a sense of
fear among businesses, and organizations started focusing on continuity plans. In addition to this,
my workload increased with some of my projects going into advanced stages of a transaction’s life
cycle. Facing these challenges, I tried to make the most of the time that I was saving because of
working from home, and continued the preparation, albeit at a slow pace. It sure was a bumpy ride,
but I kept myself motivated to focus on the process and put in my best effort, as it could well have
been my last shot at a two-year MBA program. Come result day, I had managed a decent score and
was hopeful of some interview shortlists. In addition to IIM-L, I had two other interview calls, IIM-L
being the best one.<br><br>
<h4>The Wait for Verdict</h4><br>
It was time to put in the efforts for the final lap of the selection process, the interviews. I would say
IIM-L tested me in a way by not announcing the interview schedule well in advance. It always kept
me guessing and be ready for the interview at a notice of 48 hours only. I believe that this phase
built a lot of patience in me and taught me to always be prepared. The much-awaited day arrived
after a month and a half from the day shortlist was announced. Having gone through multiple mock
interviews, I was excited and nervous at the same time to face the interview of one of India’s
topmost b-schools. To my surprise, the interview lasted for a short while, making it extremely
difficult for me to gauge how I had performed. Thus began the phase 2 of the waiting period, the
wait for final selection results. These two and a half months kept me guessing where next two years
of my life were going to be. It involved being anxious, curious, excited, nervous and many other
emotions throughout the phase.<br><br>
<h4>D-Day</h4><br>
An email said the 1 st offer list was released, and with that IIM-L had found another way of putting my
patience to test when the website showed technical error for hours. But as they say, “all is well that
ends well”. I feel the selection process made me a stronger person. From the journey to Hel(L), I look
forward to the journey at Hel(L).

<h2 class="blog-title mt-4 mb-2">Was it worth it? - Santokh Malik</h2>
<div class="blog-image-container">

</div>
<p class="text-justify">Hello everyone, I am Santokh Malik, IIM Lucknow class of 2023. I am a qualified Chartered
accountant with 5 years of work experience in Banking industry. I have worked with two of the
leading international banks -Barclays and HSBC. Today as I sit to pen down my story of getting into
one of the most prestigious b-schools of India, it’s a sense of accomplishment, immense pleasure
and contentment that overwhelms me, making me feel that all my efforts have finally bore fruit. It’s
not a success story but my journey of turning my dream into reality.

<p>
Year was 2019, month of April, when I decided to pursue my MBA journey. It definitely was not easy
to start studying once you’ve been into corporate for so long. I went to the nearest coaching centre
got myself enrolled to the CAT programme and it all began. CAT 2019 was just 7 months away and
seeing the curriculum gave me goosebumps. I juggled between office and studies for the next few
months till the D-day. 70 minutes in to the exam and it was clear to me that I am not going to make
it this time. Still after the exam I waited for the result and that wasn’t pretty at all. I didn’t get call
from any of the b-schools. Voices of my colleagues, friends and family, which I seemed to have been
neglecting all the while, suddenly became louder and louder – ‘Is it really worth quitting your job for
study right now?’<br><br>
But I had made up my mind. It was the time to introspect what went wrong and not to rethink on my
decision. For me covid happened to be a blessing in disguise. I started prepping myself up yet again.
But this time I resorted to self-study. I was able to allocate ample time to my studies along with
office; thanks to the work from home setup. I tried giving as many mocks as possible and performed
thorough analysis. I identified my strong areas and started to build upon those. The areas where I
wasn’t comfortable, I only focussed on the basics. Gradually my mock score started to increase.<br><br>
After the D-day 29 th November I was eagerly waiting for the results. I scored 96.76 percentile with
95.92 percentile in DILR (from 58.39 in CAT 2019). Like most of the MBA aspirants I also dreamt of
getting into one of the top business schools of India. Seeing the score, I didn’t keep my hopes high
but fortunately I was able to get call from IIM Lucknow, Indore, Shillong, and the new and baby IIMs.
After getting the calls, I was overwhelmed. But the journey wasn’t complete yet. Last lap was still
left. I started preparing for GDPI rounds with the help coaching mentors. For me PI was not as big a
challenge as the academics’ part was. I had over 4 years of work-ex at that time and I was pretty
comfortable in talking to people. I wrote my answers got them approved from the mentors and was
all ready to give the interview. Online interviews were completed mid of March and then the wait
began. As it is said “in our waiting, GOD is working”. Final results started pouring in from May
onwards and luckily, I was able to convert all the calls but my dream turned into reality when I
received the much-awaited email from IIM Lucknow - “We are happy to inform you that you have
been selected.” That email just made my day; and every moment of my two years of preparation
seemed to be worth. I could see 2 golden years for me in front of my eyes.<br><br>
In past 2 years I interacted with alums of multiple b-schools and the passion which they had while
sharing their experiences, the way their eyes sparkled is what I wanted for me and that is what kept
me going. It’s only been few days for me to be part of IIML community and these days have been the
best in last few years as far as I remember. I interacted with some really wonderful people and can’t
wait to begin my journey with them.
Signing off

<h2 class="blog-title mt-4 mb-2">You land up where you are destined - Vidhi Chowdhury</h2>
<div class="blog-image-container">
</div>
<p class="text-justify">I am Vidhi Chowdhury, 23 years old, a qualified CA, CS, and Rank 8 from St. Xavier’s College, Kolkata. 2020 has been an eventful year. Starting with becoming CA on 16th January 2020, which was also my mom’s birthday to securing job in Wipro Limited in Feb 2020. I was very excited to go to Bangalore for work in March but then things took a turn and lockdown was announced. All my plans of exploring different places became a dream again and all I was doing was work from home.

</p>
<span id="landup-dots" style="display: inline; "></span><span id="landup-more" style="display: none;text-align: justify;"> 
<p>
I feel since I was working from home, I decided to give a shot to CAT and so appeared for CAT 2020. Till then I had no idea of what all I had to prepare for CAT and so I contacted a friend who had appeared for CAT 2019. From that a learned that there are three sections, one for VARC which was English, one LRDI which was more on logics and lastly QA which was maths. Then my friend suggested me to give a CAT 2019 paper as mock without any preparation to understand from where to start and what to focus on. After doing that, what I understood was that my LRDI is strong and for Quants, I had to revise the formulas well and for VARC, I had to practice a lot. After analyzing these things, I decided to take a self study course from IMS so that I have availability of mock and then they had some concept videos which helped a lot. I used to see the concept videos mainly for Quants as it gave me all the required formulas and shortcuts needed. But then I was also working and it was my first job so I had to perform well there too hence I could not give the required attention to CAT. Months passed by and all I was doing was watching concept videos. One month before exam, I became a bit more serious and started to give mocks but from there I realized that my mock scores were quite fluctuating and I had to strategize more. Cut short to 10 days before exam, I took a leave from my office and studied for like 15-16 hrs a day. I would practice RCs a lot, for quants I would practice different kinds of sums and kept revising the formulas and for LRDI I just saw one video of studybuzz that had different sums of LRDI. Those 10 days, I kept giving mocks and analyzing my mistakes but did never touch even a 90 percentile in any of the mock. I also remember searching 2 days before exam on Youtube that “how to do VARC in 1 day”, this might seem stupid but then I found a video of Unacademy of an hour which was a game changer for me.  <br><br>
Comes the exam day, mine was slot 2, I was getting ready to leave for the centre which was approximately 40kms from my place and then all of a sudden, I started feeling a severe stomach ache. But, anyways I left for the exam, kept my mind cool and prayed that at least before the exam, my stomach ache stops. We reached the centre and just like 10 minutes before the exam, I felt all good and the stomach ache was gone (In between, I can’t even say how many times I felt like leaving the exam because of the pain but anyhow managed to keep my cool).<br><br>
I gave exam with a cool head and did not let any section affect the other. <br><br>
I got my result (VARC-91.14, LRDI- 96.88, QA-92.72, Overall- 96.42)<br><br>
I got a call from all the colleges except ABC. All my interviews went well. But a special mention to my IIML interview where because of some technical issue, my camera was switching off again and again so they asked me to log in from a different laptop and then they started the interview, it all went good but at the end the interviewer told me that it is time for you to get a new laptop to which I replied that I would surely get one if you admit me to your college.<br><br>
After all these I got a selected in IIML and accepted the offer. I always feel that we should believe in our destiny because somehow it works. I truly feel that I was destined to IIM Lucknow.I thank my parents, family, teachers and friends for their support.

<p class="text-justify">"Do you know depreciation? Calculate 'your' depreciation value."... Are you laughing? No, don't. That's
the question I was asked in IIML interview. It's not the starting, it's not the end, what we remember is
what has been the most impactful thing. We learn a lot from our interview experiences and try to
remember them in as much detail as possible, but we can’t remember each and every word. However
we do remember things that affect us the most or a selected few unique questions. In my interview
experiences I came across a lot of things that affected me to a great extent and made me emerge as a better individual.

"Do you know depreciation? Calculate 'your' depreciation value."... Are you laughing? No, don't. That's

we do remember things that affect us the most or a selected few unique questions. In my interview
experiences I came across a lot of things that affected me to a great extent and made me emerge as a better individual.
My journey to IIML has been challenging as well as full of learnings. I have been good at academics since childhood which made me think that working a little harder will take me to my goals. But this preparation made me realize that everyone in this race has been good in some or the other way, and I
needed to be the best to win the race and excel at this place. So I started working towards that. Once
we know what we want, it becomes easier to achieve it. I did my CAT preparation with a proper
schedule, setting small targets for everyday. Though I also missed those targets a lot of times, I kept going. <br><br>I focused more on self study as this was the method that was going to help me understand my strengths and weaknesses and I would advise everyone to understand its importance. I got a better percentile than my previous CAT attempt. From my past experience I knew I would get some calls so I started preparing for the interviews. During that preparation I met a lot of new people (virtually!), and learnt many new things which helped me in shaping my thoughts related to the interview, developing my personality as well as discovering my own potential. Out of all my interviews of the old IIMs, Lucknow was the best. After a series of bad interviews I had lost hope and the results also didn't bring much positivity. IIML's interview went little better than the rest but as we know our definition of good is not the same as that of the interviewers', so hoping was the only option. But I kept a positive mindset with the thought that whatever the result be, it would teach me something. I was asked questions from everything- academics, hobbies, about my city and HR related questions. And in all, books became my savior. According to me the best answer I gave was about the books I've read (my hobby). Apart from all the preparations, the thing with least effort you need to do to crack an interview is confidence and a little smile on your face.<br><br>
We all have a purpose in our life and we should be able to put in all our efforts to achieve that purpose. I won't say that I'm very confident and clear about my future goals, because, let's be honest, a lot of us are not! We are in the process of learning, and discovering ourselves everyday. But that doesn't mean it’s okay to live without a purpose. If not too long into the future, still we should set for ourselves little hurdles to overcome and gradually keep on climbing the ladder to success with determination.

<h2 class="blog-title mt-4 mb-2">Hel(L) awaits me! - Laghudeep </h2>
<div class="blog-image-container">

</div>
<p class="text-justify">The very first time I got to know about MBA & a B-school was when I was in my 3rd year of graduation. Some random people were talking about some entrance exam ‘CAT’ and giving BT. I was like, what the hell is it! I was listening to them talking- “Baki sab to ho jeaga, but Verbal thoda dekhna pdega”. I became a little curious and googled about it. From there I came to know about CAT & IIMs. I thought "Ok, thik hai! Chodo abhi, baad me dekhenge".

</p>
<span id="hellawaits-dots" style="display: inline; "></span><span id="hellawaits-more" style="display: none;text-align: justify;"> 
<p>
So, during my graduation, apart from getting basic information about CAT & IIMs, I did not do much about it. My real journey towards IIMs started when the first lockdown was announced by our PM. I was working in L&T as an Execution Engineer and office work was on the lighter side. Also, I was looking for a career change and was thinking of upgrading myself on the management side. So, what could have been a better time to start CAT preparation. Hence, I went for it. Lockdowns after lockdowns were chapters after chapters of quant for me. During these lockdown periods, I had almost completed quant and hence had confidence in myself to continue my preparation even after it was lifted and I will have to work in the field from 8:00 am to 7:00 pm. I planned to study 2-3 hours after that. Some days were tough.<br><br> Sometimes I was demotivated. Sometimes I was confused. But I didn’t skip even two days from my study plan. All those hard works & consistencies helped me in facing even a different exam pattern. My exam went well and the results were even more exciting. Hard work paid off! <br><br> 
I got an interview call from all old IIMs apart from IIM A & IIM C. I gave interviews for IIM B, L, K, I & CAP.
My IIM B & L interview went very well & IIMK & IIMI went average. I was sure of converting IIMB or IIML.
But sometimes things won’t happen in the way you would have thought. I got a rejection from B & waitlisted in L, K & I.  First, I converted IIMI then IIMK and then IIML. IIML offer came a little late. By then I wasn’t having much hope for converting. I think sometimes Uparwala wants you to cross many different paths until you reach your final destination. I was totally into IIMK, doing the assigned tasks and then one day I got a mail from IIML. Yes! Admission offer from IIML. What a special feeling it was- I can’t describe it in words. It felt like I was flying in the air. I informed my colleagues at L&T, my parents & my friends and they were all really happy for me while I was still flying. <br><br> 
Something this good happened to me after a long time and I am grateful to everyone who was part of my journey to IIML. The journey inside hel(L) awaits me.

<h2 class="blog-title mt-4 mb-2">Choices are the hinges of destiny - Aanchal Jain </h2>
<div class="blog-image-container">

</div>
<p class="text-justify">“It is our Choices that show us what we truly are far more than our abilities”<br><br>
I have been a firm believer of this statement-always and here I am narrating my journey to my dream.
</p>
<span id="choices1-dots" style="display: inline; "></span><span id="choices1-more" style="display: none;text-align: justify;"> 
<p>
It all started when I heard about B-schools in my good old school days. When we were asked about our aim in school, I used to tell them with a firm conviction in my voice that one day, I will go to a B-School. However, after school, life has its own plans. I decided to pursue CA following the trend to utilise the idle time we have during graduation days.<br><br>
After that, My MBA dream quickly became a blurred vision as my CA Journey took control over my life. I decided to finish what I have started and decided to forgo MBA at that time.<br><br>
However as you know, “Dreams never die, it just gets lost.<br><br>
Post clearing CA, My professional journey began and I started working in KPMG in the assurance division at Bangalore. During my tenure, I got an amazing and encouraging team who always pushed me to do things beyond my potential.  One day, one of my colleagues suggested me to do MBA and again, the fire of going into a B-School inside me ignited. I started taking morning tuitions for the same. I also took a decision not to take any leaves in between and entered into an arrangement with my Manager that I will be taking all leaves for my CAT preparation. As my work responsibilities increased with time, my time for preparing for the CAT also got affected. With some days of preparation, I gave CAT but could not score much.<br><br>
Next year, I decided to give myself another choice. I decided to give CAT for the last time against my family desires. <br><br>
This time, not only I cleared CAT with flying colors but also got calls from  my dream colleges. Finally on 20 May 2021, my dreams came true and I converted the call of one of the prestigious college i.e. IIM Lucknow. At that moment, I was infinite and felt a sense of fulfillment. <br><br>
Then comes another challenging task to convince my parents as being from a traditional hindu family, their priority was to get me married. But somehow, I convinced them.<br><br>
With lots of arguments still going on, I finally enrolled myself for my dreams with a hope that one day my parents would tell me that I made the right decision. I will leave no stone unturned to make it.
